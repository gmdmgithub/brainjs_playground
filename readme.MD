## install most important packages at start

```node
$ npm init -y
$ npm i brain.js
```

## write sample code based on

https://coderoncode.com/machine/learning/2016/06/06/machine-learning-a-simple-neural-network.html

## run the code

```node
$ npm run dev
or 
$ node ./js/main.js
```

## second example based on recurrent Neuron Network

```node
$ npm run devR
```
